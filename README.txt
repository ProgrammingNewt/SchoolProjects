Protein Synthesis Simulator

Description:

This is a Protein Synthesis Simulator. The program is a protein sysntesis simulator which will take in an input of one letter codes for each of the 20 amino acids
and then use this information to create a protein object.
Upon launch, protein objects are created by reading strings of amino acids encapsulated within the "proteins.txt" file. 

Menu Options:

The program allows users to do the following:

Show all Amino Acids: Display a comprehensive list of all 20 amino acids with important data points such as weight, one letter code, and charge.

Create Protein (Up to 3 stored): Creates new protein objects from amino acids.

Show Protein(s): Displays all of the user made proteins.

Delete Last Amino Acids: Removes the last amino acids.

Completely Delete Specific Amino Acid: Completely deletes a desired amino acids from a chosen protein.

Exit: Exits and saves modifications are safeguarded within "proteins.txt".

Delete Protein: Completely deletes a protein.

Show total net weight and charge of a Protein: Analyzes protien objects and displays their weight and charge.

Add an Amino Acid to a Protein: Adds amino acids to an extablished protein object.
